//***** TESTING *****/
// * I think can find a to do a few things here
// * There must be a way to mock Mondo DB (TEMP storage) and then I can create a new apolloServer with that mock
// * Create a Test Server util
// * Use close to all the request so you only have to test in one place
// * Feel like you can use this to do all your other react testing ()

// * It would be cool if you could do it with no server running but at this stage it is fine since
// * you are not hooking it up to CI and can just running on you machine (if you find a way that would be dope)

// * IDK How to test sockets but sure the is a way...
